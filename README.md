# SQL Challenge

The repository contains an analysis of employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. This project contains end to end database creation: 
  1. Data Modeling
    - Inspected a CSV and sketched out an ERD of the tables on [Quick Database Diagrams](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).
  2. Data Engineering
    - Used the information you have to create a table schema for the CSV files. Specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Then, imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
  3. Data Analysis
    - Used SQL to look up various data about employees including: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
